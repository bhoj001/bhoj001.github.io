### <span style="color:#2980b9"><u> Intro </u></span>
Hi there! 

<br>
I am Bhoj, a Master's graduate in Computer Science from the <a href="https://louisiana.edu/" >University of Louisiana at Lafayette</a>. I am open to new opportunities and am particularly interested in pursuing a career in software engineering and deep learning. My passion lies in building applications and solving real-world problems related to software engineering, sensor data processing, and deep learning.

<br>
In summer 2022, I worked under <a href="https://www.xialihei.com/about/" >Dr. Sharon </a> to analyze defense mechanisms in generative models, especially targeting Da Vinci Surgical Robot. During my graduate studies, I worked under <a href="https://vrlab.cmix.louisiana.edu/people/dr-christoph-borst/" >Dr. Christoph Walter Borst</a> in exploring user identification and emotion recognition in VR using multimodal sensor data and deep learning.
